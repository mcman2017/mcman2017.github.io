### Markdown

The site you are viewing is 100% markdown, rendered with Jekyll using the slate theme, published via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

[]:#(an invisible comment?)

use three backticks to display raw markdown, not parsed into HTML, like:  
```
[]:#(an invisible comment?)
```

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/mcman2017/DevSecOps/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
